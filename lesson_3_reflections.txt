When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you're sharing!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can choose when you want to merge. There may be conflicts with others contributing to your project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are on github - what i usually think of a branch in perforce.
clones - copying a repository. this is really the same as a fork, but could be local.
branch - different labels for development paths in a repo. similar to pvcs labels

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you're offline, you can reference any copies that have been pushed to github while you're doing your work
