How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It narrows down your search to only what changed
You can see a side by side comparison to identify bugs

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You do time lapse views, see when something changed, etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: can group logically
cons: can lose work if power loss, absent mindedness, etc.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
different use cases - if the files have dependencies or not

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log will tell you checkin comments and such
Git diff shows you what lines changed in each file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you can always revert to a previously working one, and then diff to figure out bugs

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Creating web pages and learning full stack development
